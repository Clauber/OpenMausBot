// Who may use a Mac lent to an OMB Cloud home (docs/cloud-pro.md, "Let my
// Cloud use this Mac"). A Cloud home is one person's server, but not every
// turn on it is theirs: a guest the owner paired, a webhook's payload, or a
// line someone else slipped into a running turn must never reach the Mac.
//
// A turn may use the lent Mac only when the harness can prove it acts for the
// owner:
// - a conversation the owner started from one of their own devices (a live
//   session with admin scope), or
// - a scheduled run of a routine whose instructions the owner wrote (created
//   or edited from one of those devices), or a run the owner started by hand;
// and the conversation holds nobody else's words, ever: a resumed session
// carries everything said in it, so one line (or card answer) from a guest,
// a teammate bot or a local process, before or during the turn, takes that
// conversation out of lending. The owner starts a new one to lend again.
// Webhook runs, guests, rooms, a bot's delegated or peer turn, and anything
// unprovable never can.
// Everything here is pure; server/index.ts supplies the records.
