# OMB Cloud Pro: the home machine

Cloud Pro gives one person an always-on OpenMausBot server of their own. Each
customer gets one Fly app with one `home` machine that is always on, a volume
at `/data`, and TLS at `https://<app>.fly.dev`. The desktop app, the phone and
the web are windows onto it. Local use of the app is unchanged and free.

Cloud Pro includes no AI usage. The person signs in on their machine with their
own Claude or ChatGPT subscription, or an API key, through the same sign-in
flows as any OpenMausBot server. Nothing on a Cloud home is routed to a
platform model gateway.

This page is the OpenMausBot half of a contract with three parties:

- **the home machine**: this repository's `deploy/fly/` image;
- **the Admin** (openmaus-cloud, `docs/consumer-cloud.md` there): provisions
  the app, holds the machine's signing secret, and answers the desktop's Cloud
  session;
- **the desktop app**: signs in to Cloud, lists the machine under Servers,
  and offers **Connect to my Cloud**.

Contract version: `1` (`cloudContractVersion` on the wire).

## What the person sees

1. They subscribe on the Cloud site. The Admin creates the Fly app and machine.
2. They open the desktop app, go to **Settings → OMB Cloud** and sign in (the
   existing device sign-in). A **Your Cloud** card says **Setting up** until
   the machine is up.
3. When it is ready, the machine appears under **Servers** as **My Cloud**, and
   the card offers **Connect to my Cloud**. One click opens the machine in the
   app window, signed in. There is no second confirmation.
4. The first thing the Cloud shows is its engine sign-in
   (`src/components/CloudEngineSignIn.tsx`), with three choices:
   - **Sign in to Claude**: the existing paste-code flow (open Anthropic's
     page, paste the code back);
   - **Sign in to ChatGPT (Codex)**: the existing device-code flow;
   - **Use an API key**: the existing model-provider keys in **Settings →
     Connections** (Anthropic, or an OpenAI-compatible key such as OpenRouter).

   It says plainly that the account's plan limits apply to bots running 24/7,
   and that a Claude Max plan or an API key is recommended for heavy use.
5. Until one of those engines can run, every bot on the Cloud, including the
   default one, shows this sign-in rather than a chat that fails its first
   turn. Once one can run, the chat takes its place. Sign-ins stay on the
   machine's volume (`~/.claude`, `~/.codex`, the server's own config).

The Cloud's `GET /api/auth/session` answers `"cloudHome": true` for a paired
session; that is how the web UI knows to open the engine sign-in instead of
the welcome flow, which describes the person's own computer (it can still be
replayed from Settings). A paired session without admin scope (a phone paired
as a client) is not shown the sign-in, since it cannot sign engines in.

The card shows one of: **Setting up**, **Ready**, **Stopped**, **Payment
problem**, **Could not be set up yet**. Only Ready can be connected to.
Signed out of Cloud, the app makes no Cloud request and nothing on this page
runs.

### Where bots work

A Cloud home is a headless Linux server, so its bots have two places: the
built-in browser and cloud computers. It never offers **This computer** (that
would be the server itself) or a **Local VM** (a Fly machine has no container
runtime). The person's own Mac is reached only when they lend it (**Let my
Cloud use this Mac**, below), through the shared-computer tools.

- Neither place is listed in the Computer panel, the composer's place chip, a
  bot's Works on setting or Settings → Computers (the config answers
  `"cloudHome": true`), nor in `select_computer`, which also drops `vm_exec`.
  Auto never lands on either.
- A bot still set to either (an older or imported setting) has each task
  refused with a sentence saying so, suggesting Auto, Cloud or Browser and,
  for This computer, lending the Mac.
- Every turn's system prompt says the bot runs in the cloud. Asked about the
  person's own computer, a bot with the shared-computer tools checks for a lent
  Mac and, finding none, says so and how to lend one; a bot without them says
  it cannot reach it. Either offers the browser and cloud computers, never a
  place that cannot exist.
- The built-in browser is on unless the person switches it off in Settings.
  The desktop turns it on in its first-run welcome, which a Cloud home skips.

`shared/cloud-home.ts` decides which places are offered, for the server and
the app alike.

### Open in the app: `openmausbot://cloud`

The Cloud page (`https://cloud.openmausbot.com/cloud`) can offer **Open in the
app** as a link to exactly `openmausbot://cloud`. The app accepts that string
and nothing else: no path, query, fragment or trailing slash, and it ignores
any other form. Like `openmausbot://organization`, it is an action, not a
router. It never carries an address, a pairing code or a credential; the app
decides everything from its own verified state (`electron/cloud-entry.mjs`).

1. The link starts the app, or brings it forward if it is already running
   (launch argument, a second instance, or macOS `open-url`, including one
   that arrives before the app is ready). If the window already shows
   **My Cloud**, coming forward is all it does.
2. Otherwise the window returns to this computer (a hosted server that was
   showing stays saved under **Servers**) and opens **Settings → OMB Cloud**.
   Before that view acts, the app gives a saved Cloud sign-in up to five
   seconds to finish restoring, so it is never mistaken for signed out.
3. Opened this way, the view acts on its own, with no confirmation:
   - signed out: it starts the existing device sign-in at once, which opens
     the browser approval page with the code filled in
     (`/cloud/desktop?code=…`);
   - signed in and the Cloud is **Ready**: it connects to **My Cloud**,
     exactly like **Connect to my Cloud**;
   - after that sign-in completes, or when the Cloud becomes **Ready** while
     the view is still open, it connects then;
   - anything else: the card shows the status and the person decides.

It starts at most one sign-in (only when signed out on arrival; a later
sign-out in that view starts nothing) and one automatic connection per link.
A failed connection shows the card's error; clicking the link again retries.
Closing Settings or choosing another section ends it. While it is open, the
first-run welcome waits, as it does for Organization settings. A normal visit
to **Settings → OMB Cloud** never signs in or connects by itself.

The link does nothing in development builds, and in companion client mode it
explains that the app must be disconnected from the other computer first.
The `openmausbot` scheme belongs to the installed app: on macOS through the
app bundle, on Linux through the `.deb`'s desktop entry, and on Windows (and
for an AppImage) once the installed app has started at least once, since it
registers itself at startup. Before that, or if the app is not installed, the
browser has nothing to open (it shows nothing or an error), so the Cloud page
should keep a download link next to the button.

## Let my Cloud use this Mac

The Cloud is home: bots and chats live there. The person's Mac is a computer
the Cloud can borrow while it is awake. Lending is off until the person turns
it on, and it exists only between their own desktop app and their own Cloud
home. Other users (desktop only, self-hosted, hosted team workspaces) keep
computer sharing exactly as before: off unless a maintainer sets
`features.sharedComputers` by hand.

### What the person sees

In **Settings → OMB Cloud**, the **Your Cloud** card has a **Let my Cloud use
this Mac** switch under **Connect to my Cloud** (it is part of connecting, not
a dialog). Turning it on shows what can be lent; each change applies at once,
with no confirmation. The switch and the chosen scopes are the consent.

- **Folders**: chosen with the folder picker. Read-only by default; **Can
  edit** lets bots create files and overwrite them, but only after reading the
  current version (the overwrite is checked against its hash). Nothing is ever
  deleted. At most 256 KiB per file, no symbolic or hard links. The home folder
  and anything above it cannot be chosen.
- **Apps and screen**: bots see the screen and use apps as the person, through
  this app's own computer control (the signed app holds Accessibility and
  Screen Recording; the Cloud never does). This is broad by nature, since it
  reaches anything those apps can, and the switch says so. It needs local
  computer control set up first.
- **No terminal.** The shell grant of maintainer sharing is never offered here.

The switch can be turned on before the first **Connect to my Cloud**; lending
starts once this Mac is signed in to the Cloud. Lending runs while the app is
open: quitting it (or the Mac sleeping) only pauses lending, and it resumes
when the app runs again with the switch still on. Below the choices, **Activity
on this computer** lists every request the Cloud made, refused ones included.

While lending is on, a menu-bar item shows it (**In use** while the Cloud is
running something on this Mac) with **Stop lending**. Turning the switch off or
choosing **Stop lending** stops at once: the Cloud is told, a running action
is cancelled (the computer-control transport is closed and the screen lease
released), and nothing more runs. An action an app had already started may
still finish.

### How it is enforced

On the Mac (the authority; `electron/computer-sharing.mjs`,
`electron/shared-computer-access.mjs`):

- **Outbound only.** Electron main dials the Cloud's HTTPS address with this
  app's own session cookie and a per-grant 256-bit secret; there is no
  listening port. The Cloud can only answer the Mac's long poll.
- **Bound to the account and the machine.** The grant records the Cloud
  account id and the machine's origin from the verified Cloud session
  (`cloud-account.mjs`), and the Cloud home's environment id on first contact.
  Signing out of OMB Cloud, another account signing in, the Cloud moving to
  another machine, or another server answering at that address ends lending
  and switches it off (turning it back on is the person's choice). A Cloud
  sign-in that must be renewed pauses lending; a minute's re-verification or an
  unreachable Admin does not. The server must say it is a Cloud home
  (`cloudHome: true`) and this Mac's session there must be one of the owner's
  admin devices. Lending never reads the maintainer flag and it never goes to
  any other server.
- **Every operation is checked against the grant here**, whatever the server
  says: the folder must be lent, writes need **Can edit**, screen actions need
  apps and screen. Jobs are validated against the server's schema first.
- **What folders never reach**, read-only or not: this app's data and grants,
  keys and sign-in stores (`~/.ssh`, `~/.gnupg`, `~/.aws`, `~/.config/gh`,
  `~/.claude`, `~/.codex`, keychains, browser profiles and cookies…) and places
  that run code (`~/Library/LaunchAgents`, git and shell configuration,
  `~/.local/bin`), decided by filesystem identity rather than spelling. Writes
  inside any `.git` directory are refused.
- **Screen tools and their arguments are an allow-list**
  (`electron/lent-screen-tools.mjs`), derived from the local driver's own
  schemas: observation and input only. The driver's tools that work outside
  the screen (uploading a file by path, recording or replaying to a path,
  configuration, installing, DevTools, killing a process, raising permission
  prompts) are refused and hidden, and so is every argument that names a path,
  a command line or a port: screenshots come back inline (never
  `screenshot_out_file` or `debug_image_out`), `launch_app` takes no extra
  arguments or inspector port and opens only `http`/`https` addresses, and a
  cursor image cannot be read from a path. Any other argument is refused, and
  the tool list the Cloud sees shows only what is accepted.
- **Activity log**: `lending-activity.jsonl` in the app's data folder, owner
  only: time, action, folder and relative path or tool name, and whether it
  ran. Never contents, output or typed text. The app only ever appends to it
  (never through a link); a full file of 500 entries is moved to
  `lending-activity.jsonl.1` intact. No folder or screen argument reaches it.

On the Cloud home (`server/shared-computers.ts`, `server/index.ts`):

- Lending is on for every Cloud home, with no maintainer flag.
- Only the owner's admin sessions (the Admin's signed pairing gives the
  desktop one) can lend. A chat-only device the owner paired cannot.
- The server refuses operations outside the scopes the Mac registered before
  queuing them, never retries an operation with an unknown outcome, and never
  substitutes its own files for an offline Mac.
- Only turns that provably act for the owner may use the lent Mac
  (`server/cloud-lending.ts`): a conversation the owner started from one of
  their own devices (a live session with admin scope), a scheduled run of a
  routine the owner wrote or last rewrote from one of those devices, or a run
  of it the owner started by hand. Never a webhook-started run (its payload
  comes from outside), a guest's conversation or routine (a device paired
  with chat-only access), a routine someone else rewrote, a room, a bot's
  delegated or peer turn, a local process on the Cloud, or anything the
  harness cannot trace. A conversation qualifies only while it holds nobody
  else's words, anywhere in it, before or during the turn: one line from a
  guest, a teammate bot or a local process (sent, queued, steered or handed
  in, or history imported with a move), or one card answer from someone else,
  takes that conversation out of lending for good, because a resumed session
  carries everything said in it. The bot is told "Someone else wrote in this
  conversation, so it can't use your Mac. Start a new conversation to use it."
  and the lending switch says the same. The owner's own edits count as theirs,
  and the harness's own automatic card settlements do not count. A
  routine stops being the owner's once anyone else edits it in any way (its
  instructions, schedule, results destination or whether it is on); the
  owner rewriting its instructions makes it theirs again. A bot whose
  **Computer** setting is off cannot use lent apps and screen.
- On a Cloud home only the owner's own devices (admin sessions) can answer a
  card or remember an approval; a guest can read along but never answer.
- What this does not cover: a bot's own memory. Notes a bot keeps while
  talking with a guest load into that bot's later conversations, the owner's
  included. Pairing a guest to your Cloud lets them talk to your bots; lend
  your Mac only while you trust everyone paired there.

### What the Cloud can see: `GET /api/shared-computers`

For the Cloud UI and the next step (placing a step on the Mac, "Waiting for
your Mac"). Client scope; on a Cloud home only the owner's own devices (admin
sessions) see the lent Mac and a guest sees an empty list; elsewhere a session
sees only its own person's. No secrets, no local paths.

```json
{ "computers": [ {
  "id": "5b3e…", "name": "MacBook-Pro",
  "online": true, "busy": false, "lastSeenAt": 1790000000000,
  "scopes": { "folders": [ { "id": "9f1c…", "name": "Plans", "write": false } ], "terminal": false, "screen": true }
} ] }
```

`online` is false once the Mac has not polled for 40 seconds (asleep, app
closed, offline); the entry stays until lending is stopped, the Mac's session
ends, or 14 days pass. The list is in memory and empty after the Cloud
restarts, until the Mac registers again (within seconds of being online).
Server code can call `sharedComputers.status(principal)` directly. Bots use
the `list_shared_computers` and `shared_computer` tools.

## The image

`deploy/fly/Dockerfile` builds on the published server image
(`ghcr.io/milind-soni/openmausbot`) and adds:

- the engine CLIs from `ENGINES` (default Claude Code and Codex; the base
  image already carries agent-browser and its Chrome);
- Caddy, as the only listener the network can reach (`0.0.0.0:8080`);
- `server/cloud-home-start.ts` (bundled to `dist-server/cloud-home-start.js`)
  as the entry point.

```sh
docker build -t openmausbot .
docker build -f deploy/fly/Dockerfile --build-arg BASE_IMAGE=openmausbot -t omb-cloud-home .
```

At boot the launcher, running as root only for this step, hands the volume's
mount point to the `maus` user, drops privileges for good, binds the volume to
this machine (`/data/.omb-cloud-home.json`; another machine's volume, or an
unmarked volume with data on it, is refused), and runs two children: the
server on `127.0.0.1:8799` (webhooks on `127.0.0.1:8800`) and Caddy on
`:8080`. If either exits, both stop and Fly restarts the machine. The one
exception: after a restore commits (Move to Cloud, below), the server exits
with code 75 and the launcher starts only the server again.

`HOME=/data`, so `~/.claude`, `~/.codex` and OpenMausBot's own data
(`/data/.openmausbot`) persist on the volume.

### Why the server stays on loopback

`server/request-auth.ts` treats an unproxied loopback request as the
machine's owner. The server therefore never binds a public interface. Caddy
(`deploy/fly/Caddyfile`) forwards every request with `X-Forwarded-Proto:
https` and `X-Forwarded-For`, so the server sees each one as remote: it needs
a paired session, whatever `Host` it claims. Caddy trusts `Fly-Client-IP`
only from Fly's private ranges; that address feeds the pairing lockout, never
authorization. Apart from `/api/health`, Caddy answers only for the machine's
own name (`OMB_PUBLIC_URL`) and refuses any other `Host`.

### Fly

The Admin creates the machine through the Machines API; `deploy/fly/fly.toml`
is the same shape for a manual deploy: `internal_port = 8080`, `force_https`,
no auto-stop, one machine always running, a volume `omb_home` at `/data`,
restart policy `always`, and an HTTP check on `GET /api/health` (it answers
`{"app":"openmausbot"}` with no session). Each customer's app lives in its
own Fly private network, so no machine can reach another's over 6PN.

## Boot contract

Set by openmaus-cloud's provisioner (`server/cloud-machines.ts`). Any of the
first four switches the server into Cloud home mode; then all of them are
required and the whole contract is validated. A partial or invalid contract
stops the server before it serves, with a message that names the variable and
never echoes a secret.

| Variable | Fly | Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `OMB_CLOUD_ROLE` | env | `home`. (`desktop` belongs to the Cloud desktop image and is refused here.) |
| `OMB_CLOUD_MACHINE_ID` | env | The Admin's machine id (a UUID). Binds the volume. |
| `OMB_CLOUD_ADMIN_URL` | secret | The Cloud origin, exact `https://`, e.g. `https://cloud.openmausbot.com`. |
| `OMB_CLOUD_BOOTSTRAP_SECRET` | secret | 43 base64url characters (256 bits): the key the Admin signs pairing requests with. |
| `OMB_PUBLIC_URL` | env | The machine's exact `https://` origin, `https://<app>.fly.dev`. |

- The machine must not also carry `OMB_ADMIN_URL`, `OMB_ADMIN_WORKSPACE` or
  `OMB_ADMIN_MEMBERSHIP`: a Cloud home is a personal server with pairing codes
  on, not a hosted team workspace with portal membership.
- `HOME=/data` and `OMB_DATA_DIR=/data/.openmausbot` are set by the image.
- The server keeps the secret in memory and removes it from its environment at
  startup; no engine or tool it starts ever inherits it.

### No model gateway

Cloud Pro includes no AI, so the contract has no model gateway. If a Cloud
home is ever given `OMB_HOSTED_MODEL_URL`, `OMB_HOSTED_MODEL_TOKEN` or
`OMB_HOSTED_MODELS` (an Admin from before this decision set all three), it
still boots, logs one warning naming the variables (never their values), and
ignores them:

- the launcher drops them from the server's environment, and the server drops
  them from its own at startup, so no engine or tool ever sees them;
- the portal workspace model policy (`server/hosted-models.ts`) stays off on a
  Cloud home whatever they hold, so no instance is routed to a gateway;
- no `included.*` or other read-only instance is served; the person's own
  engines are the only way to a model.

### Included Boat computers, voice and decisions

Pro includes Boat cloud computers, ElevenLabs voice and the decision model
(TypeSafe's Jev, [decision-model.md](decision-model.md)) with no key to paste.
For each service the Admin has configured, it also sets:

| Variable | Fly | Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `OMB_CLOUD_BOAT_URL` | env | `https://cloud.openmausbot.com/api/cloud/services/boat/api/box/v1`, the Admin's Boat relay. It keeps Boat's own `/api/box/v1` ending, so the Computer engine's model catalog (`<root>/api/provider-models`) resolves through the relay too. |
| `OMB_CLOUD_BOAT_TOKEN` | secret | This machine's Boat relay token (`box_omb_…`). It is not a Boat key and works only through the relay. |
| `OMB_CLOUD_VOICE_URL` | env | `https://cloud.openmausbot.com/api/cloud/services/voice/v1`, the Admin's voice relay. |
| `OMB_CLOUD_VOICE_TOKEN` | secret | This machine's voice relay token (`omb_voice_…`). |
| `OMB_TTS_DEFAULT_VOICE` | env | An ElevenLabs voice id, used until the person picks a voice or another speech provider in Settings. |
| `OMB_CLOUD_DECIDER_URL` | env | `https://cloud.openmausbot.com/api/cloud/services/decider`, the Admin's Jev relay. It is a Jev base URL, used as it is: the decider adds `/v1/systemone`, the relay's only route, so every included decision goes to exactly `<OMB_CLOUD_DECIDER_URL>/v1/systemone`. |
| `OMB_CLOUD_DECIDER_TOKEN` | secret | This machine's decision relay token (`omb_decide_…`). It is not a Jev key and works only through the relay. |

A service is included only when both its URL and its token are set
(`server/included-services.ts`). The real Boat, ElevenLabs and Jev keys stay
on the Admin, which checks the subscription, the monthly caps and which
computers belong to this machine on every request.

- **The person's own key always wins.** An included token is a fallback, used
  only while the person has no key of their own: none saved in Settings
  (`box.token`, `tts.key`, `decider.key`) and no `BOX_TOKEN`, `OMB_TTS_KEY`
  or `OMB_JEV_API_KEY` in the environment. Adding a key switches to it at
  once; removing it falls back to the included service again (for Boat, once
  that key's cloud computers are deleted: removing a Boat key that still has
  computers is refused). The choice is made on every request.
- **Each credential goes to one place.** The relays know only the Admin's
  accounts, so an own key goes only to the provider (`OMB_BOX_API`,
  `OMB_ELEVENLABS_API` or `decider.baseUrl` when set, for development and
  tests, else Boat's, ElevenLabs' and Jev's own APIs) and an included token
  only to its relay, whatever those settings say.
- **The decision relay takes two requests, and the app sends it nothing
  else.** Through the included token the app sends only room routing's
  request (one question `answer`, a choice with the fixed instructions in
  `server/decider/room-routing.ts`, and state keys `room`, `humans_in_room`,
  `bots_in_room`, `new_message` and, when there are recent lines,
  `recent_messages`) and the Settings key check's fixed request, within the
  relay's caps (a body of at most 64 KiB, a state of at most 24,000 bytes as
  JSON). `server/decider/relay.ts` checks each request before it is sent; one
  that does not fit is not sent, and the room falls back as for any other
  decision-model failure. Any other decision job, now or added later, uses
  only the person's own Jev key until the relay accepts it too.
- **Included decisions are on until switched off.** While the decision model
  runs on the included token, its master switch counts as on unless the person
  switched it off in **Settings → Decision model**; an explicit off always
  wins, and switching it back on needs no key. The per-job switches keep their
  defaults, so rooms set to Auto ask who answers, and new rooms start on Auto,
  as with a saved key. An own Jev key is on once saved, as anywhere else, and
  clearing it falls back to the included decisions without switching them
  off.
- **An included token is never the person's key.** It is never written to
  `config.json`, never sent to a client (Settings sees `configured` and
  `included: true`, and says "Included with Cloud Pro"), and Settings never
  verifies, rotates or clears it. The decision model's **Test** button, with
  no key pasted, makes one tiny call through the relay, never to Jev
  directly. Boat's account-change rules still apply: adding an own Boat key
  while included cloud computers exist is refused until they are deleted,
  because the new account cannot reach them.
- **What holding the tokens does and does not do.** The server reads the
  tokens at startup, keeps them in memory and removes them from its
  environment, like the bootstrap secret, and they are on the credential list.
  So no process the server starts inherits them, including tools that copy
  its environment as it is (the browser, docker, ssh, MCP bridges). It does
  not make them unreadable: the launcher starts the server with them, so the
  server's `/proc/<pid>/environ` keeps its startup environment, and an engine
  running as the same user (a bot with a shell) can read a relay token there.
  That is accepted because a relay token is only this customer's own Cloud Pro
  allowance: it works only through the Admin, only on this machine's cloud
  computers, voice and decisions, and only up to the monthly caps. Whoever
  holds it can at worst use up this month's included hours, voice characters
  or decisions; it opens no other customer's data and none of the Admin's
  provider keys.
- A refusal from the Boat or voice relay (for example, the month's cloud
  computer hours are used up) is shown as the relay's own message. A resume
  that fails with a server error is retried on the next poll, as Boat asks.
- A refusal from the decision relay (401 for an unknown token, 402 without an
  active subscription, 429 over the month's cap or a rate limit, 502 or 503
  upstream) never reaches a turn: as with any decision-model failure, the room
  does what it would without it (its lead answers). Only **Test** shows it,
  as a fixed sentence.

## Pairing: the Admin's signed request

`POST https://<app>.fly.dev/api/cloud/pairing`

```http
POST /api/cloud/pairing
Content-Type: application/json
x-omb-cloud-timestamp: 1790000000
x-omb-cloud-nonce: <base64url, 16–128 characters>
x-omb-cloud-signature: v1=<base64url HMAC-SHA256(OMB_CLOUD_BOOTSTRAP_SECRET, canonical)>

{"label":"OpenMausBot app (Cloud)","ttlSeconds":300}
```

where `canonical` is

```text
v1\n<timestamp>\n<nonce>\nPOST\n/api/cloud/pairing\n<base64url SHA-256 of the raw body>
```

`200`:

```json
{ "code": "ABCD-EFGH-JKLM", "credential": "omb_pair_…", "expiresAt": 1790000300000 }
```

`code` and `credential` are two encodings of **one ordinary pairing window**
(`server/sessions.ts`): single use, admin and client scopes, redeemed at the
machine's existing `POST /api/auth/pair`.

| Status | Body | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `401` | `{"error":"invalid_signature"}` | Wrong key, tampered request, or malformed headers. Counts toward the per-source pairing lockout. |
| `401` | `{"error":"stale_request"}` | Timestamp more than 300 s from the machine's clock. |
| `401` | `{"error":"replayed_request"}` | Nonce already used in the last 10 minutes. |
| `429` | `{"error":"rate_limited","retryAfterSeconds":n}` | Too many bad signatures from this source. |
| `400` | `invalid_body`, `invalid_label`, `invalid_ttl` | Not a JSON object; label not plain text of 80 characters or fewer; TTL not a positive integer. |
| `405`, `415` | | Not a POST; not JSON. |

Rules the machine enforces: the signature is checked first, in constant time;
the timestamp within ±300 s; each nonce refused for 10 minutes; `ttlSeconds`
defaults to 300 and is capped at 600; nothing about the request (headers, body
or code) is logged. Nonces live in memory, so a restart forgets them; a
captured request is still bounded by its five-minute timestamp window and TLS.

## What the desktop reads from the Admin

The desktop polls `GET /api/cloud/desktop/session` with its personal device
token (`Authorization: Bearer omc_…`). Contract version 1 adds:

```json
"cloud": { "state": "ready", "origin": "https://omb-u-1a2b3c4d5e6f.fly.dev", "pairingAvailable": true }
```

- `null` or absent when the account has no machine; the app then shows nothing new.
- `state` is `setting_up`, `ready`, `stopped`, `payment_problem` or `failed`.
  `origin` is required for `ready`. Any other state (including the retired
  `allowance_used`) is treated as no machine. Other fields, such as a retired
  `allowance`, are ignored.

**Connect to my Cloud** first asks the machine whether this app is already
signed in there (`GET <origin>/api/auth/session` with its cookie). If not, it
calls `POST /api/cloud/desktop/pairing` (same device token) and expects
`{"cloudContractVersion":1,"origin":…,"code":…,"expiresAt":…}` for the same
origin, with `expiresAt` at most ten minutes away. It then adds or selects the
**My Cloud** server entry and opens `<origin>/pair#code=<code>`, the same
pairing-link flow as Connect to a server. The code stays in main-process
memory for that one navigation: never on disk, never in a renderer. A
malformed session summary or grant is treated as none.

## Move to Cloud

One action copies everything from the person's own computer to their Cloud:
bots, chats and their messages, attachments, memory, routines, skills, rooms
and teams, and the settings a workspace backup carries. It is a copy; nothing
on the computer changes. Chat history travels between machines here, and only
here, because the person asked for it. Secrets never travel.

### Where it is

- **Settings → OMB Cloud**, under Your Cloud once it is Ready: **Move to
  Cloud** (`src/components/CloudMove.tsx`). Before anything starts it shows the
  size and the counts (`GET /api/cloud-move/estimate` on the computer's own
  server), and says that API keys and sign-ins stay on the computer and that
  the person signs in to Claude or ChatGPT on the Cloud (the Cloud's first-run
  engine sign-in above).
- When the Cloud already has bots or chats, the button reads **Replace my
  Cloud with this computer's workspace**, and the card says that what the
  Cloud holds is replaced, backed up on the Cloud first, and put back by **Swap
  back to previous Cloud**. There is no confirmation dialog. Without a session
  on the Cloud yet (never connected), it says the same thing conditionally.
- The first time the app shows an empty Cloud (its starter bot at most, no
  rooms, nobody has chatted) and the computer has work of its own, the Cloud's
  page shows a card: **Bring your bots and chats from this Mac** ("this
  computer" elsewhere), with **Move** and **Not now**. Not now hides it for that
  Cloud for good; it never blocks anything. Only the desktop app shows it, and
  main answers the Cloud page only when it is the verified Cloud (the origin the
  Cloud session reports) open as the window's active server. That page can
  start a move only from the person's own click (`navigator.userActivation`)
  and cannot swap back to the previous Cloud.

### What moves, and what stays

Exactly what a workspace backup carries (`server/workspace-backup.ts`,
`server/workspace-backup-policy.ts`). Never: API keys, provider and MCP
connections, engine sign-ins (`~/.claude`, `~/.codex`, the server's
`providers/`), saved credentials, pairing, paired devices and sessions (the
session registry's open marker included: a restore leaves the destination's
own marker in place, so a crash just before it still ends account sign-ins),
the server's identity, caches,
downloaded tools and runtime files. Never this app's Cloud sign-in or what
it lends (Let my Cloud use this Mac, above): both live in the desktop app's
own storage, not in the workspace, and a lent Mac reconnects once the Cloud
has restarted. Unsent drafts and window preferences stay on the computer.

The Cloud keeps its own: every connection section of its config (engine and
API keys, the included Boat and voice relays, sign-in allow-lists), its
sessions and pairing, its engine sign-ins, its computer-sharing switch
(`features.sharedComputers` always stays with the machine a backup is restored
on), and its boot contract (the environment, and the volume marker outside the
data folder). As with any restore, routines, webhooks and scheduled calls
arrive paused and nothing queued runs; the person turns routines on in the
Cloud when they want them to run there instead. A bot that used an engine or
API key the Cloud does not have asks for one there, and a bot pointed at a
project folder outside the workspace keeps that path, which the Cloud does not
have: the files inside the workspace move, folders elsewhere on the computer
do not.

### How it moves (`electron/cloud-move.mjs`, `server/cloud-move-http.ts`)

1. Main opens a session of its own on the Cloud. The Admin opens a single-use
   pairing window for the signed-in owner (`POST /api/cloud/desktop/pairing`),
   and main redeems it at `/api/auth/pair` for a bearer token held only in
   memory. That session is labelled "Move to Cloud" and signed out when the
   move ends.
2. The computer's server exports its encrypted backup with a random password,
   under the usual rule that bots finish their turns first, and main copies it
   to a private temporary file, hashing it.
3. `POST /api/cloud-move/upload {sha256, bytes, files}`. The Cloud refuses more
   than 10 GB of data or 100,000 files (`413`), and checks its free space: the
   upload three times over (the upload, its decrypted copy and its staged
   files), plus twice its own workspace (the backup it takes first, briefly
   with its snapshot), plus 256 MB. A part stored by an earlier upload, of any
   file, counts as free: a new upload replaces it. Cloud volumes have a fixed
   size (the Admin's `OMB_CLOUD_VOLUME_GB`, 10 by default). Not enough room is
   `507` with `freeBytes` and `neededBytes`, and the app shows both. Nothing
   has been moved at that point. A new upload also deletes whatever an earlier
   attempt staged.
4. Parts of 16 MB (at most 64): `PUT /api/cloud-move/upload/<sha256>?offset=n`.
   A part already stored is accepted again without being written; any other
   offset answers `409` with `received`; a part that fails is cut back off.
   Main retries with backoff and continues from where the Cloud stands. An
   upload that keeps failing keeps its archive for 30 minutes, so moving again
   continues it rather than starting over; the Cloud keeps a stored part for a
   day, and its startup deletes an older one.
5. `POST /api/cloud-move/preview {sha256, password}`: the Cloud checks the
   SHA-256 and stages the file as an ordinary backup, which authenticates the
   whole file before parsing anything. Anything that is not a valid backup is
   refused and the upload discarded.
6. `POST /api/cloud-move/restore {id}`, inside the maintenance gate: the
   Cloud's workspace is backed up first (below), then the restore is committed
   and the server exits with code 75. The launcher
   (`server/cloud-home-start.ts`) starts only the server again, and startup
   installs the restore before anything else loads. Preview, restore and undo
   can take minutes, so each answers `202` and runs as a job the app follows
   in `GET /api/cloud-move`. A Cloud that answers `409` (another step still
   running) is asked again with the same staged workspace. A restore that
   fails on the Cloud (bots that stay busy past a few tries of the gate, for
   one) deletes what it staged and the backup it took.
7. Main waits until the Cloud reports that restore installed
   (`lastRestoreId`), signs its session out, and opens My Cloud in the window.

Stopping before step 6, or any failure before it, asks the Cloud to drop what
the move staged (`POST /api/cloud-move/discard`; a preview still running drops
its result when it ends). A stored upload part stays, for moving again.

### Swap back to previous Cloud

Before a move replaces the Cloud's workspace, that workspace is backed up to
`.backups/cloud-previous` on the Cloud's own volume, which no backup includes
and no restore replaces. Its random password is kept beside it: the same volume
holds the same data unencrypted anyway. It is offered as **Swap back to
previous Cloud** unless it is a fresh Cloud's (its starter bot at most, no
rooms, nobody has chatted).

Swapping back (`POST /api/cloud-move/undo`) is the same restore the other way
round: the workspace the Cloud has now is backed up first and becomes the
previous Cloud, so a swap back can itself be swapped back, and nothing done on
the Cloud since the move is lost. It needs room for the previous Cloud staged
and installed plus that backup (`507` otherwise).

That archive is the one undo point kept. A new backup waits in
`.backups/cloud-previous.next` and replaces it only once startup has installed
the restore it was made for (a restore that never commits or rolls back leaves
the previous Cloud as it was). Once a move's or swap's restore is installed,
startup deletes its safety copy (`.backups/safety-<id>`) and its staged files,
so `.backups` holds about one workspace, not four. `GET /api/cloud-move`
reports the previous Cloud's size (`previous.bytes`, shown in Settings) and
everything `.backups` holds (`heldBytes`). A restore made from Settings →
Backups keeps its safety copy as before.

### Move security

- Every Cloud route needs a paired session with admin scope. A client-scope
  device is refused, and so is a bare loopback request. That second refusal
  is not a wall against the machine itself: a process there (a bot's shell)
  runs as the server's user, already reads and writes `/data`, and can pair
  itself as the owner through loopback like any owner tool. Only a Cloud home
  receives a workspace; any other server answers `404`, except for sizing its
  own (`/api/cloud-move/estimate`).
- The upload is bounded by its declared size, the per-part limit and the
  backup's own limits on size and file count.
- The bundle is the workspace backup: credentials are left out by path and by
  a config allowlist, and checked again at staging (a config with connection
  settings or webhook secrets is refused). Staging never decompresses: tar is
  told not to, and gzip or zstd payloads are refused. `server/cloud-move.e2e.test.ts`
  gives the desktop keys, a driver environment, workspace credentials and a
  provider login, scans the exported bundle for them, moves it to a real Cloud
  home, and scans every file on the Cloud's volume.
- Nothing logs a request body, the password, a file name or bundle contents.

## Security summary

- The server never listens on the network; only Caddy does, and nothing it
  forwards is the loopback owner.
- Pairing windows are opened only for a request signed with the machine's
  secret, fresh and never replayed; each window is single use and short lived.
- The signing secret is removed from the server's environment at startup and
  is never passed to engines or to Caddy.
- There is no platform model gateway: stray `OMB_HOSTED_*` settings are
  ignored with one warning and never reach the server's environment or an
  engine. Every model call uses the person's own sign-in or key.
- A volume binds to one machine and is never adopted by another.
- Each customer's app lives in its own Fly private network.
- A lent Mac is reached only through its own outbound connection, within the
  scopes the person chose, which the Mac itself enforces (see "Let my Cloud use
  this Mac").

## Published image

Every push to `main` and every release tag publishes the home machine image as
`ghcr.io/milind-soni/openmausbot-cloud-home`, tagged `latest` (main only), `sha-<commit>` and the release tag.
It is built from `deploy/fly/Dockerfile` on top of the server image for the same commit, with Claude Code and
Codex installed. The Docker workflow's summary prints the digest. Set it in the Admin as
`OMB_CLOUD_HOME_IMAGE=ghcr.io/milind-soni/openmausbot-cloud-home@sha256:…`; changing it rolls the new image
out to existing machines one at a time, reverting automatically on a failed health check.
